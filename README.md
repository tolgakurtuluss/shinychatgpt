## 🌟 Key Features

### 🔑 API Key Input
To enable the assistant, users need to enter their OpenAI API key. This key connects directly to the OpenAI API, giving you access to the full functionality of your chosen GPT model.

### 🧠 Model Selection
Select from a range of models, including:
- **GPT-4**
- **GPT-4-0314**
- **GPT-3.5-Turbo-0301**
- **GPT-3.5-Turbo**

Each model has unique capabilities, balancing complexity and response times based on your needs.

### 🎛 Adjustable Settings
* **Temperature Control**: Adjust the randomness of responses; a higher value (closer to 1.0) makes outputs more diverse, while a lower value (closer to 0.1) makes them more focused.
* **Max Length**: Customize the length of AI responses to keep interactions brief or allow detailed answers.
* **System Prompt**: Set the tone and behavior of the AI with a custom system message for a more guided experience.

### 💬 Real-time Chat Interface
Engage with the AI through an interactive chat interface that displays a detailed history of user and AI exchanges. Additionally:
* **Clear Chat History**: Start fresh with a new conversation.
* **Download Chat History**: Save your chat history as a text file to review or analyze later.
